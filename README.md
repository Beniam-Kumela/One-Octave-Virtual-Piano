# One-Octave-Virtual-Piano
This is a limited virtual piano through which a user can play all middle octave notes, with clear, resonant, and damped sounds. 

The pygame module was further explored through this project, understanding how sound files and collision detection work together within the Python module.
It was also the first time I created sprites and learned about strenuous coordinate adjustment and compilation.

Some extensions for the future can include: additional octaves, indication of when note is being pressed, and an overall cleaner GUI.

Below is a video of the piano in action:

The main.py script can be downloaded to access the piano.
